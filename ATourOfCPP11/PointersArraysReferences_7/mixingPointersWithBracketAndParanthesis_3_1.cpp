/**
 * !!!THIS IS INCOMPLETE AND SHOULD BE IMPROVED!!!
 * 
 * There were a couple of rules. 
 * 1- Go right when you must.
 * 2- Brackets and paranthesis have precedence over pointers and references.
 * 
 * int* a[5]; a is (precedence, go right) an array of 5 pointers to int.
 * 
 * int a*[5]; a is a pointer to array of five integers.
 * 
 * We must always remember that out-of-range access is never checked. Hence, it results in 
 * UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR.
