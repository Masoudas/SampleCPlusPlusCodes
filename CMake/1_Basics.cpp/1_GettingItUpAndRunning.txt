First off, in VSCode we can install the CMake extension to help with the syntax.

Essentially, we need two things:
1- A main.cpp, where the code will start from
2- A CMakeLists.txt, that holds the essential commands of CMAKE.

So the content of the lists file:
Version line: Indicates the version required to compile the cmake project.
How can we get CMake version in VS? Well, the path to CMake is at this:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft
For the version, I couldn't find anything in VS. I had to use the internet.
