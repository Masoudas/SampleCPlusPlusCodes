First off, in VSCode we can install the CMake extension to help with the syntax. 

We will assume that the goal of this make is to create an executable. What CMake does (particularly through the install
command) is that not only will it generate the executable we need, but also puts it where it should go (namely Program Files (x86)
in Windows, and perhaps the lib folders in Linux).

Of course to create the executable, we need to specify which file contains it (which will be done through the add_executable
command of CMake).

Every path to every file can be determined using the "${PROJECT_NAME}". Note that:
1-	${} is the structure for defining variables in CMake.
2-	We put the quotation marks so that if the path has space it will be read coherently.
3-	PROJECT_NAME has the same as the project root folder. This is the folder where CMakeLists.txt is placed.

DON'T Confuse project root folder with project name. project_name command gives a name to this project. In Windows,
this name would be given to the solution as well. Moreover, the executable (and the folder it's put in Program Files (x86))
would have the same name as this one.


Essentially, we need two things:
1- A main.cpp, where the code will start from
2- A CMakeLists.txt, that holds the essential commands of CMAKE.

So the content of the lists file:

Version line: 
		Indicates the version required to compile the cmake project. How can we get CMake version in VS? 
	Well, the path to CMake is at this: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft
	For the version, I couldn't find anything in VS. I had to use the internet.

add_executable:
		We're declaring which file contains our main method here. As we said, we can do so using the ${PROJECT_NAME}. Note that
	we can or cannot use a dash here, saying "${PROJECT_NAME}" "/Main.cpp". But "${PROJECT_NAME}/Main.cpp" is not correct.

install:
		Installs WHATEVER WE ASK IT TO to the BUILD DESTINATION. Build destination in my Windows machine is where all the 
	programs are, which is Program Files (x86). ???
